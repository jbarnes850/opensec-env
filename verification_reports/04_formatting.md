# Formatting Compliance Report
Generated: 2026-02-06
Target: ICML 2026

## [PASS] Compliant Elements

- **Document class**: Uses `\documentclass{article}` with `\usepackage[preprint]{icml2026}` -- correct for preprint/under-review submission.
- **Style file**: `icml2026.sty` (v2.0, dated 2025/10/29) is loaded and matches the official ICML 2026 template.
- **Page count**: 6 total pages. Main body (Introduction through Related Work) spans approximately 4.5 pages. References begin on page 5. Appendix A on page 6. Well within the 8-page body limit (references and appendix are excluded from the page count).
- **Abstract word count**: Approximately 157 words. Within the ICML guideline of 150-250 words.
- **Section structure**: Abstract, Introduction, Environment Design, Reward Design, Baseline Evaluation, Discussion, Limitations, Future Work, Related Work, References, Appendix. All expected sections present.
- **Two-column layout**: Correctly uses `\twocolumn` via `icml2026.sty`. Page dimensions are 8.5in x 11in US Letter as required.
- **Table formatting**: All three tables (Tables 1, 2, 3) use `booktabs` package (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`). No vertical rules. Consistent `\scriptsize` or `\small` font sizing. Captions placed above tables via `\caption` before `\begin{tabular}`.
- **Figure formatting**: Both figures use `figure*` (full-width) with `[!t]` placement. Captions placed below figures. Image widths set to `0.85\textwidth`.
- **Bibliography**: Uses `natbib` with `icml2026` bibliography style. Author-year citation format with parenthetical style (`\citep`, `\citet`). 14 references in `references.bib`.
- **Required packages loaded**: `microtype`, `graphicx`, `booktabs`, `hyperref`, `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `subcaption`, `float`.
- **Running title**: `\icmltitlerunning{OpenSec: IR Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence}` defined. No "Title Suppressed" warning in log, so it fits within the header width.
- **Author/affiliation format**: Uses `\icmlauthor`, `\icmlaffiliation`, `\icmlcorrespondingauthor` commands correctly. `\printAffiliationsAndNotice{}` called.
- **Keywords**: Defined via `\icmlkeywords`.
- **No page layout violations**: The `icml2026.sty` margin integrity checks pass (no "page layout violates the ICML style" message in log or PDF).
- **No overfull hbox warnings**: Zero overfull `\hbox` warnings in the compilation log.
- **No LaTeX errors**: Compilation completed successfully with zero errors.

## [WARN] Minor Issues

- **Underfull \vbox (badness 10000)**: 7 occurrences across pages 1-5. These occur during `\output` (page breaking) and are typical in two-column layouts. They indicate columns that could not be filled optimally. Not a formatting violation but may result in slightly uneven column heights. Locations: page 1 (1x), page 2 (2x), page 3 (2x), page 4 (1x), page 5 (1x).
- **Underfull \hbox (badness 3271)**: At lines 91-92 in paragraph about "conditional state transitions." The word spacing is loose in the line containing "di-tional state tran-si-tions. Com-bined with vari-able". This is a minor typographic issue in the Scenario Design subsection.
- **Underfull \hbox in Table 1 caption**: Two instances (badness 2865 and 1515) at line 122. The table caption text has loose word spacing. This is cosmetic and common with long captions in narrow column widths.
- **hyperref Warning -- Token not allowed**: `removing '\\' on input line 40`. The `\\` in the `\icmltitle` (line break in the title) generates a PDF metadata warning. The title renders correctly in the document but the PDF metadata title may contain a stray character. This is cosmetic and does not affect printed output.
- **hyperref Warning -- empty anchor**: `Ignoring empty anchor on input line 42`. Generated by `\printAffiliationsAndNotice{}` with empty argument. Harmless; does not affect output.
- **Float specifier changed**: `'h' float specifier changed to 'ht'` (line 744, the appendix table). The `[h]` placement on Table 3 (Appendix, line 231 of source) was overridden by LaTeX. Consider changing `[h]` to `[ht]` or `[t]` in the source to suppress this warning.
- **Related Work placement**: Related Work appears as Section 8 (after Future Work). ICML does not mandate a specific placement, but many ICML papers place Related Work earlier (after Introduction or before Discussion). The current placement is valid but unconventional.

## [FAIL] Non-Compliant Elements

- None identified. The paper compiles cleanly and meets all ICML 2026 formatting requirements.

## [INFO] Compilation Status

- **Compiler**: pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.27 (TeX Live 2025/Homebrew)

- **Output**: main.pdf, 6 pages, 3,996,437 bytes (~3.8 MB)
- **Errors**: 0
- **Warnings**: 2 hyperref warnings (cosmetic), 1 float specifier change, 7 underfull vbox, 3 underfull hbox
- **Figures included**: `figures/opensec-design.png` (page 3), `figures/seed-generation-pipeline.png` (page 5)
- **Memory usage**: 689,583 / 5,000,000 words (13.8%) -- well within limits

## Summary

**14 checks passed, 7 warnings, 0 failures.**

The paper is fully compliant with ICML 2026 formatting requirements. All warnings are cosmetic (loose word spacing in two-column layout, PDF metadata artifacts, and a float placement override). The main body is well under the 8-page limit at approximately 4.5 pages before Related Work. No action is required for submission, though the float specifier on the appendix table (`[h]` to `[ht]`) could be changed to suppress one warning.
